# Web Design Fundamentals

## Purpose
A repository mainly just for me to make presentable notes on various web design concepts that I feel should be considered fundamentals for web designers. Every project will have a demo project within it's folder which houses a fully functioning web app demonstrating the specific tool pertaining to that "tutorial" as well as a markdown file detailing the process as well as trying to teach how everything works so whoever reads it will be able to not only replicate but also implement into their own projects. 

## Disclaimer
It's still quite messy and not everything works but I'm sure over time this will become more more presentable and could serve as useful aids not only to myself but whoever else is starting out in web development!
